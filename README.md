# Police-Brutality-vs-Weather

### Problem Statement:
In the one year time period from July 01, 2014 to June 30, 2015, the temperatures in Houston, Texas and Jacksonville, Florida peaked some of its highest values. Additionally, after doing some online research, we've observed some consistent data that reveals the police-related fatality rates for these two states to be considerably higher than than the rest of the United States. With this information, we've decided to seek a correlation between the monthly deaths by police in these specific states and the average high temperatures for that month of popular cities belonging to these states.

### Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the city with the larger average highest temperature for the month will also have the higher police-related fatalities in the given month.

### Methodology, Approach, Observations:
Can be found inside project.

### Conclusions:
Our initial hypothesis was proven to be correct and using the 3D scatter plot under the visualization section, it is noticeable that the city with the average highest temperatures for each month, Jacksonville, Fl, also happens to have a higher number of fatalities by police. For this data, we can conclude that there is a strong correlation between the high temperatures in a certain region and the number of police-related fatalities in that region.
